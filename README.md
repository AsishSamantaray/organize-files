# organize-files
It is always good to organize the files so that you can easily find the file when it is required. That's why I wrote a Python script which copy the files based the file extension and put the files in the respective folder. Ex: All pdf, excel, word files will move to Documents folder. One thing you need to do is to modify the base directory i.e. the directory / folder you want to organize the files.
