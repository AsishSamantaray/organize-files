# OrganizeFile
It is always good to organize the files so that you can easily find the file when it is required. That's why I wrote a Python script which copy the files based the file extension and put the files in the respective folder (Coz I'm lazy :hand_over_mouth:).
For an Example : All pdf, excel, word files will move to Documents folder. 

## TODO
One thing you need to do is to modify the base directory i.e. the directory / folder you want to organize the files. **Enter the path on Line number - 9**
